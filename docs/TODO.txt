	# check for updates (if files exist); .. and show 'em, also in overview at the end

		# where 'get()' is being called atm., just test for existence before, ..

			# and then maybe 'getLength()' to a callback which compares sizes, then optionally enqueue() again

				# maybe after unlinking the existent files.. and their symlinks maybe, too..

	# `getopt.js`! siehe 'kekse1/getopt.js'.

!!	# better 'tryQueue()' calling?!

		# and 'get()' in there maybe w/ setTimeout(.., 0)

		# and instead of second-timeout use Date.now() diff

		# better design, in general!
