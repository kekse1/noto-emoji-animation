# Animated Emojis by Google
[Google: The hub for everything animated emoji!](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/)

This was a requested feature: as Google wasn't willing to 'allow' to download all the animated emojis
all in one packet, so one would need to scroll/traverse through the whole list, to manually download
each one (and each one got three file types/formats atm.).

I just hacked a bit into the `view-source:` and found everything necessary..

The reason for me to clone \*all\* the emojis was my private website (TODO), where I decided to parse
all the emoji tags and replace them with the unicode symbol (string) and/or the real images (atm there
are [ WebP, GIF, Lottie ]). And I really don't like to link to any Google server (same w/ Google Fonts)!

## STATE: **BETA**
